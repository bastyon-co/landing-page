# Cursor Rules

## Code Structure
- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Keep components small and focused
- One component per file

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `ButtonComponent`)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `handleClick`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_ITEMS`)

## Import Organization
- React imports first
- Third-party libraries next
- Local imports last
- Use absolute imports with @ alias

## File Organization
- Components in `/components` folder
- Utilities in `/lib` or `/utils` folder
- Types in `/types` folder
